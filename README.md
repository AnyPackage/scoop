## Known Issues

### Finding/Installing different package versions

Scoop does not maintain multiple versions for a single package name.
You can pass the version you wish to install but it does a find/replace on the version in the app manifest.
Then Scoop will try to use that to install the app but only at install time.
As such AnyPackage.Scoop does not allow for this arbitrary method.
To install versions than the latest use the versions official package source.
